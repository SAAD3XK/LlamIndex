The word robot, spelled\\nrobota in Czech, was introduced into the literature by the\\nwriter Karel Capek in his 1921 play, “R.U. R” (Rossum's Universal\\nRobots). It signified a factory where biosynthetic machines are\\nused as forced labor. In the middle of the last century, Isaac\\nAsimov immortalized the word “robot” in a collection of short\\nstories of modern science-fiction. The first mention of a\\nhumanoid automaton, however, can be traced back to the\\nthird century in China when a mechanical engineer, Yan Shi,\\npresented to the Emperor Mu of Zhou, a human shaped figure\\nof mechanical handiwork built with leather, wood and\\nartificial organs [1].0 In the 12th century, a Muslim golden\\nage scholar, polymath, inventor, and mechanical engineer\\nnamed al-Jazari created a humanoid robot able to strike\\ncymbals. During the Renaissance period, Leonardo da Vinci\\nmade a detailed study of human anatomy to design his\\nhumanoid robot. His sketches drawn in 1495, were only\\nrediscovered in the 1950s. Leonardo's robot was a knight\\nrobot that was able to stand-up, sit-down, wave arms and\\nmove head and jaw. It was operated by pulleys and cables.\\nMore important than his accomplishments in this area, da\\nM E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9 ( 2 0 1 7 ) S 3 6 – S 4 0\\n☆ Publication of this article was supported by the Collège International de Recherche Servier (CIRS).\\n⁎ Correspondence to: P.

With continued progress in electronic\\nspeed, capacity, and software programming, computers\\nmight someday be as intelligent as humans. One cannot\\nneglect the important contribution of contemporary cyber-\\nnetics to the development of AI.\\nDefined as a trans-disciplinary approach, cybernetics aims\\nfor control of any system using technology that explores\\nsystem regulation, structure and constraints, most notably\\nmechanical, physical, biological, and social. The origin of\\ncybernetics is attributed to Norbert Wiener [2], who formal-\\nized the notion of feedback, with implications for engineering,\\nsystems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience,\\nphilosophy, and the organization of society. Fields that were\\nmost influenced by cybernetics are (if we exclude game\\ntheory) systems theory, sociology, psychology (especially\\nneuropsychology and cognitive psychology), and theory of\\norganizations.\\nToday literature on AI is abundant and unbridled. AI was\\nportrayed as a possible threat to the world economy during\\nthe 2015 economic forum held at Davos, where Stephen\\nHawking even expressed his fear that AI may one day\\neliminate humanity [3]. We will not discuss here the use of\\nthis rapidly developing field in military, security, transport or\\nmanufacturing; instead, the focus of our chapter is on\\nmedicine and health systems.\\n2.\\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine:\\nThe Virtual Branch\\nThe application of AI in medicine has two main branches:\\nvirtual and physical. The virtual component is represented by\\nMachine Learning, (also called Deep Learning) that is represented\\nby mathematical algorithms that improve learning through\\nexperience. There are three types of machine learning\\nalgorithms: (i) unsupervised (ability to find patterns), (ii)\\nsupervised (classification and prediction algorithms based\\non previous examples), and (iii) reinforcement learning (use of\\nsequences of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for\\noperation in a specific problem space). First, AI has boosted\\nand is still boosting discoveries in genetics and molecular\\nmedicine by providing machine learning algorithms and\\nknowledge management. An example of successes in medi-\\ncine is the unsupervised protein–protein interaction algo-\\nrithms that led to novel therapeutic target discoveries [4]. The\\nmethodology used a combination of adaptive evolutionary\\nalgorithms and state-of-the-art clustering methods, named\\n“evolutionary enhanced Markov clustering”. It permitted\\nprediction of over 5000 protein complexes, of which over\\n70% were enriched by at least one gene ontology function\\nterm [4]. Novel computational methodology is also being\\ndeveloped to identify DNA variants such as single nucleotide\\npolymorphisms (SNPs) as predictors of diseases or traits,\\nusing novel evolutionary embedded algorithms that are more\\nrobust and less prone to over-fitting issues that occur when a\\nmodel has too many parameters relative to the number of\\nobservations [5].\\nToday's “systems thinking” about health care not only\\nfocuses on the classical interactions between patients and\\nproviders but takes into account larger-scale organizations\\nand cycles. Furthermore, the health care system must not be\\nstationary but must learn from its own experiences and strive\\nto implement continuous process improvements. This is a\\nmulti-agent system (MAS), where a set of agents situated in a\\ncommon environment interact with each other. This process\\ninvolves building or participating in an organization, which\\nuses AI to achieve significant progress.\\nAn\\nexample\\nof\\nsuch\\na\\nprocess\\nin\\nmedicine\\nis\\nthe\\ndevelopment of problematically complex ecosystems for\\ntreating chronic mental diseases [6]. Instead of focusing on\\nhealth\\nexpenditures\\n(in\\npublic\\nhealth\\nsystems) or\\ncost\\nrecovery (in health management organization), the MAS\\napproach proposes to capture the dynamics of individual\\npatients, including their responses to received medications as\\nwell as their behavioral interactions within a larger societal\\necosystem.

Its implementation has allowed health\\nsystems managers to analyze the dynamics of system\\nperformance across changes in social, medical and criminal\\njustice components [7].\\nIncluded in the virtual applications of AI are electronic\\nmedical records where specific algorithms are used to identify\\nsubjects with a family history of a hereditary disease or an\\naugmented risk of a chronic disease. AI is used to improve\\norganizational performance by enabling individuals to cap-\\nture, share and apply their collective knowledge to make\\n“optimal decisions in real time”. As a consequence, electronic\\nmedical records and health care process management are\\ncrucial to achieve the desired quality. From current patients'\\nrecord keeping of variable quality, information needs to be\\ncaptured in a digital format accessible as individual data as\\nwell as in aggregated forms for epidemiological research and\\nplanning. Major efforts are required from academia and the\\ninformation technology industry to achieve desired efficacy\\nand minimize cost.\\nThe current status of medical records is mostly in the form\\nof incommunicable silos of wasted information for the health\\nsystem and for knowledge acquisition. Laboratories and\\nclinics need to collaborate to accelerate the implementation\\nof electronic health records [8]. Data need to be captured in\\nreal-time, and institutions should promote their transforma-\\ntion into intelligible processes. New scientific and clinical\\nfindings should be shared through open-source, and aggre-\\ngated data must be displayed for open-access by physicians\\nand scientists and made automatically available as point-of-\\ncare information. Integration and interoperability including\\nethical, legal and logistical concerns are enormous, particu-\\nlarly with the forthcoming addition of “omics-based” data.\\nThe simplification, readability and clinical utility of data sets\\nshould be made evident, and each result must be questioned\\nfor its clinical applicability. Our group has developed such a\\ndesign as illustrated in Fig. 1. Electronic medical or health\\nrecords are essential tools for personalized medicine and for\\nearly detection and targeted prevention, again with the aim of\\nincreasing their clinical value and decreasing health costs [9].\\nFurther virtual application of AI in medicine is the use of\\nsoftbots, as psychotherapeutic avatars [10]. Avatars stem from\\nthe famous 2009 James Cameron movie which features a\\nhybrid human–alien created to facilitate communication with\\npeople from the planet known as Pandora. The use of\\nemotionally sensitive teachable avatars is receiving recogni-\\ntion in medicine [11]. It has been applied to pain control in\\nchildren with cancer (called “pain body”) and it is able to detect\\nearly emotional disturbances in youngsters in native Amer-\\nican reservations, including suicidal tendency.

The system encourages the\\nsubject to engage in discussions with his persecutor who\\nprogressively learns to moderate such destructive behavior.\\nInitial successes with this technology have been demonstrated\\nby achievement of a lower level of hallucinations and vocal\\nthreats. Perhaps the most useful function will be in care of the\\nelderly, where the frequency, reassuring nature, and kindness of\\nwhat is said are all important elements of improved communi-\\ncation. Avatars have been also applied to home care, and for\\nbiological and physical monitoring with 3D vision [12].\\n3.\\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine:\\nThe Physical Branch\\nThe second form of application of AI in medicine includes\\nphysical objects, medical devices and increasingly sophisti-\\ncated robots taking part in the delivery of care (carebots) [13].\\nPerhaps the most promising approach is the use of robots as\\nhelpers; for example, a robot companion for the aging\\npopulation with cognitive decline or limited mobility. Japa-\\nnese carebots are the most advanced forms of this technol-\\nogy. Robots are used in surgery as assistant-surgeons or even\\nas solo performers [14]. One of the most impressive examples\\nof the utility of robots is their ability to communicate with and\\nteach autistic children. Here, and in many other situations\\nthat might benefit from robotic intervention, important\\nethical considerations will have to be resolved before it will\\nbecome possible to use AI-robots routinely in today's medical\\nenvironment. Apart from ethical issues, a major challenge in\\nthis new dimension of medical care is the clear need for\\nstandardized, comparative evaluation of the effect of robotic\\nsystems on health indicators, and measures of changes in\\npsychological and physical status, side effects, and outcomes [15].\\n4.\\nUse of Robots to Monitor Effectiveness\\nof Treatment\\nRobots can also be useful in the evaluation of changes in\\nhuman performance in such situations as rehabilitation [16].\\nAnother area where AI might be helpfully employed is for\\nmonitoring the guided delivery of drugs to target organs,\\ntissues or tumors. For example, it is encouraging to learn of\\nthe recent development of nanorobots designed to overcome\\ndelivery problems that arise when difficulty of diffusion of the\\ntherapeutic agent into a site of interest is encountered. This\\nproblem occurs when the therapist is attempting to target the\\ncore of a tumor which tends to be less vascularized, anoxic,\\nbut most proliferatively active. To overcome limitations of\\nmechanical\\nor\\nradioactive\\nrobotics,\\nresearchers\\nhave\\nattempted to harness a natural agent with desired properties\\nas a replacement of “intelligent” nanoparticles alone. For this\\npurpose, they are studying a special type of marine coli, called\\nMagnetococcus marinus which travels spontaneously to low\\noxygenated zones. Initial guidance is provided by an external\\nmagnetic source and then inherent properties of nanorobots\\nare put into play. These nanorobots can be covalently bound\\nwith nanoliposomes bearing therapeutic properties. Early\\ndata have disclosed a significant increase in the gradient of\\ndesired drug into the hypoxic zones [17].\\nMost of these novel applications of AI in medicine need\\nfurther research, particularly in areas of human–computer\\ninteractions. Moshimo Mori [18] introduced in 1970 the notion\\nof uncanny valley in which an important theme is the human–\\nrobot interaction (HRI) field. In these studies humanoid robots\\nwere evaluated for their apparent humanity, eeriness and\\nattractiveness as factors making perception of robots either\\nacceptable, feared or rejected [19].\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nAI for personal use is going to stay with us much as genetics will\\ncontinue to provide personal services. It is therefore important to\\nconsider how AI will also serve the development of our health\\ncare systems. Takashi Kido [20] proposed MyFinder as a person-\\nalized community computing to resolve challenges of personal-\\nized genome services, acting jointly with AI and shaping the\\npersonalized and participative health care of the future. The goal\\nof this platform is to provide personal genome environment\\ninteraction in both directions: impact of genes on diseases,\\nhealth and drug responses, and impact of our environment,\\nbehavioral and wellness on our gene activities. The World\\nEconomic 2016 Forum named open AI ecosystem as one of the 10\\nmost important emerging technologies. With the unprecedented\\namount of data available, combined with advances in natural\\nlanguage processing and social awareness algorithms, applica-\\ntions of AI will become increasingly more useful to consumers.\\nThis is particularly true in medicine and healthcare where there\\nare many data to be utilized from patient medical records and\\nlately also from information obtained by wearable health\\nsensors. This huge volume of data should be analyzed in detail,\\nnot only to provide patients who want suggestions about\\nlifestyle, but also to generate information aimed at improving\\nhealthcare design, based on the needs and habits of patients. It is\\nimportant to tear down the prejudices and fears regarding AI and\\nunderstand how it could be beneficial and how we can cope with\\nits perceived or real drawbacks. The biggest apprehension we\\nhave is that AI will become so sophisticated that it will surpass\\nhuman brain capabilities and eventually will take control over\\nour lives. However, if we succeed in creating ethical standards,\\ndeveloping measures of success and effectiveness, making it\\navailable to the mainstream, and not only to the Ivy League\\nmedical institutions, by making AI tools open-source and user-\\nfriendly and of proven clinical utility, then societal benefits will\\naccrue from the use of AI.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Ted VanItallie for\\nhis excellent comments and suggestions and for the editorial\\nreview of their manuscript.

European leaders and the European Parliament have condemned this \\nunprovoked and unjustified military aggression in the strongest possible terms, as it grossly violates international \\nlaw and undermines European and global security. Ukraine applied for EU membership on 28 February, and \\nMoldova followed with its own application on 3 March. The European Council granted candidate country status \\nto both countries on 23 June 2022. During the first month of fighting, Ukrainians repelled many Russian attacks, \\nconducted counter-offensives and liberated some areas, most significantly around the capital Kyiv. On 2 March, \\nthe UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution reaffirming Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity \\nwith a broad majority.  \\nThe war has left thousands of Ukrainian civilians dead and injured, and cities partially razed to the ground. \\nAccording to the UNHCR, more than 5.2 million refugees, mostly women and children, have been recorded as \\nhaving fled to neighbouring countries. In addition, as of 23 June the International Organization for Migration \\nestimates that more than 6.2 million people have been internally displaced, despite the fact that 5,5 million \\ninternally displaced people have already returned to their homes. European Parliament resolutions have \\nhighlighted the situation of women and children fleeing the war. The EU and its allies, within and beyond NATO, \\nhave adopted hard-hitting sanctions aimed at causing severe damage to the Russian economy.  \\nIn an unprecedented move, the EU mobilised resources under the European Peace Facility to provide military \\nassistance, including lethal equipment, to Ukraine. On the humanitarian front, the EU is providing aid, including \\nthrough the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, and has activated the Temporary Protection Directive. Humanitarian \\naid mobilised by the European Commission consists of €348 million of humanitarian funding in response to the \\nwar in Ukraine, of which €335 million for Ukraine and €13 million for Moldova.  \\nThe conflict has become Europe's worst security crisis since the end of the Second World War. The future impact \\nof the war not only on the EU economy but also on other economies is largely unknown, depending not least \\non the duration of the war and on policies adopted by countries and companies around the world to find \\nalternatives sources of energy, raw materials and food. Cereal and oilseed exports from Ukraine are being hit \\nhard, not only because of the war but also because of the Russian blockade of Ukraine's ports on the Black Sea. \\n \\nAll EPRS publications related to this topic can be found in one place on the EPRS blog.

The \\nimpact of Russian cyber-attacks has prevented access to basic services as well as constituting data theft and \\ndisinformation, including through deep fake technology. Organisations and governments around the world have \\nnot been indifferent to the hybrid risks thus posed. EU-, US- and NATO-led initiatives have aimed at neutralising \\ncyber-threats and protecting essential infrastructure.  \\n \\nRussia's war on Ukraine: Implications for transport \\nBriefing by Monika Kiss, with contributions by Karin Jacobs and Jaan Soone, June 2022 \\nThe unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine has damaged transport infrastructure, caused major transport \\ndisruptions and led to a massive flow of refugees into the EU and neighbouring countries. The EU has introduced \\nmeasures to support traffic flows and supply chains, securing the swift and safe transfer of people trapped in \\nwar zones and the transfer of essential goods and commodities.  \\n \\nWorld Refugee Day: EU solidarity with Ukraine \\n'At a glance' note by Anita Orav, June 2022 \\nIn December 2000, in a resolution to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the \\nStatus of Refugees, the UN General Assembly designated 20 June as World Refugee Day. According to the UN, \\nat the end of 2020 there were 82.4 million forcibly displaced people in the world; nearly 26.4 million of them \\nwere refugees and around half of those were under 18 years old. In 2022, following Russia's war on Ukraine, \\nEurope is facing a large new wave of refugees in search of peace and security. \\n \\nInvestigating and prosecuting international crimes \\nBriefing by Ann Neville, June 2022 \\nThis briefing discusses investigations into core international crimes in Ukraine. It looks at the identification, \\ngathering and assessment of information to ensure that it is admissible as evidence in trials of those accused of \\nthese crimes. It also analyses the specific challenges involved in the assessment of digital information and how \\nto ensure that it is properly evaluated in an era of deepfakes and digital manipulation. \\n \\nQuestion time: EU external action to address the impact of the war in Ukraine on third countries \\n'At a glance' note by Bruno Bilquin, Anna Caprile, Eric Pichon, Jakub Przetacznik, June 2022 \\nParliament had planned to use its powers of oversight in the revived 'question time' in the June I plenary session \\nto question the High Representative on EU action regarding the impact of the war on third countries. \\n \\nDomino effects of the war \\nBriefing by Lasse Boehm, Elena Lazarou and Giulio Sabbati; Graphics: Samy Chahri, June 2022 \\nThe war Russia unleashed on Ukraine has global repercussions, beyond the death toll and the human tragedy in \\nUkraine itself, and the resulting refugee flows and wider destabilising effects on Europe's east.

To guarantee security of supply, the EU will also \\nneed to ensure gas storage levels remain high so Member States can cope with a sudden interruption of gas \\nsupplies. However, both LNG terminals and gas storage capacity are unevenly spread across Europe. \\n \\nNew EU regulation on gas storage \\nBriefing by Alex Wilson, April 2022 \\nThe problem is particularly acute in the gas sector, where Russia is the leading third-country supplier, on which \\nseveral Member States are heavily dependent. To ensure the EU is prepared for the risk of an interruption of gas \\nsupplies next winter, the Commission has proposed an urgent regulation on gas storage, requiring Member \\nStates to: fill in at least 80 % of their storage capacity by 1 November 2022 (rising to 90 % in subsequent years); \\ncarry out the certification of all gas storage system operators; and provide a 100 % tariff discount on entry and \\nexit points into gas storage. \\n \\nReassessing 'citizenship by investment' schemes \\n'At a glance' note by David de Groot, April 2022 \\nThe European Parliament and European Commission have been calling on Member States not to grant \\ncitizenship in return for investment in the country concerned.

The word robot, spelled\\nrobota in Czech, was introduced into the literature by the\\nwriter Karel Capek in his 1921 play, “R.U. R” (Rossum's Universal\\nRobots). It signified a factory where biosynthetic machines are\\nused as forced labor. In the middle of the last century, Isaac\\nAsimov immortalized the word “robot” in a collection of short\\nstories of modern science-fiction. The first mention of a\\nhumanoid automaton, however, can be traced back to the\\nthird century in China when a mechanical engineer, Yan Shi,\\npresented to the Emperor Mu of Zhou, a human shaped figure\\nof mechanical handiwork built with leather, wood and\\nartificial organs [1].0 In the 12th century, a Muslim golden\\nage scholar, polymath, inventor, and mechanical engineer\\nnamed al-Jazari created a humanoid robot able to strike\\ncymbals. During the Renaissance period, Leonardo da Vinci\\nmade a detailed study of human anatomy to design his\\nhumanoid robot. His sketches drawn in 1495, were only\\nrediscovered in the 1950s. Leonardo's robot was a knight\\nrobot that was able to stand-up, sit-down, wave arms and\\nmove head and jaw. It was operated by pulleys and cables.\\nMore important than his accomplishments in this area, da\\nM E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9 ( 2 0 1 7 ) S 3 6 – S 4 0\\n☆ Publication of this article was supported by the Collège International de Recherche Servier (CIRS).\\n⁎ Correspondence to: P.

With continued progress in electronic\\nspeed, capacity, and software programming, computers\\nmight someday be as intelligent as humans. One cannot\\nneglect the important contribution of contemporary cyber-\\nnetics to the development of AI.\\nDefined as a trans-disciplinary approach, cybernetics aims\\nfor control of any system using technology that explores\\nsystem regulation, structure and constraints, most notably\\nmechanical, physical, biological, and social. The origin of\\ncybernetics is attributed to Norbert Wiener [2], who formal-\\nized the notion of feedback, with implications for engineering,\\nsystems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience,\\nphilosophy, and the organization of society. Fields that were\\nmost influenced by cybernetics are (if we exclude game\\ntheory) systems theory, sociology, psychology (especially\\nneuropsychology and cognitive psychology), and theory of\\norganizations.\\nToday literature on AI is abundant and unbridled. AI was\\nportrayed as a possible threat to the world economy during\\nthe 2015 economic forum held at Davos, where Stephen\\nHawking even expressed his fear that AI may one day\\neliminate humanity [3]. We will not discuss here the use of\\nthis rapidly developing field in military, security, transport or\\nmanufacturing; instead, the focus of our chapter is on\\nmedicine and health systems.\\n2.\\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine:\\nThe Virtual Branch\\nThe application of AI in medicine has two main branches:\\nvirtual and physical. The virtual component is represented by\\nMachine Learning, (also called Deep Learning) that is represented\\nby mathematical algorithms that improve learning through\\nexperience. There are three types of machine learning\\nalgorithms: (i) unsupervised (ability to find patterns), (ii)\\nsupervised (classification and prediction algorithms based\\non previous examples), and (iii) reinforcement learning (use of\\nsequences of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for\\noperation in a specific problem space). First, AI has boosted\\nand is still boosting discoveries in genetics and molecular\\nmedicine by providing machine learning algorithms and\\nknowledge management. An example of successes in medi-\\ncine is the unsupervised protein–protein interaction algo-\\nrithms that led to novel therapeutic target discoveries [4]. The\\nmethodology used a combination of adaptive evolutionary\\nalgorithms and state-of-the-art clustering methods, named\\n“evolutionary enhanced Markov clustering”. It permitted\\nprediction of over 5000 protein complexes, of which over\\n70% were enriched by at least one gene ontology function\\nterm [4]. Novel computational methodology is also being\\ndeveloped to identify DNA variants such as single nucleotide\\npolymorphisms (SNPs) as predictors of diseases or traits,\\nusing novel evolutionary embedded algorithms that are more\\nrobust and less prone to over-fitting issues that occur when a\\nmodel has too many parameters relative to the number of\\nobservations [5].\\nToday's “systems thinking” about health care not only\\nfocuses on the classical interactions between patients and\\nproviders but takes into account larger-scale organizations\\nand cycles. Furthermore, the health care system must not be\\nstationary but must learn from its own experiences and strive\\nto implement continuous process improvements. This is a\\nmulti-agent system (MAS), where a set of agents situated in a\\ncommon environment interact with each other. This process\\ninvolves building or participating in an organization, which\\nuses AI to achieve significant progress.\\nAn\\nexample\\nof\\nsuch\\na\\nprocess\\nin\\nmedicine\\nis\\nthe\\ndevelopment of problematically complex ecosystems for\\ntreating chronic mental diseases [6]. Instead of focusing on\\nhealth\\nexpenditures\\n(in\\npublic\\nhealth\\nsystems) or\\ncost\\nrecovery (in health management organization), the MAS\\napproach proposes to capture the dynamics of individual\\npatients, including their responses to received medications as\\nwell as their behavioral interactions within a larger societal\\necosystem.

AI is used to improve\\norganizational performance by enabling individuals to cap-\\nture, share and apply their collective knowledge to make\\n“optimal decisions in real time”. As a consequence, electronic\\nmedical records and health care process management are\\ncrucial to achieve the desired quality. From current patients'\\nrecord keeping of variable quality, information needs to be\\ncaptured in a digital format accessible as individual data as\\nwell as in aggregated forms for epidemiological research and\\nplanning. Major efforts are required from academia and the\\ninformation technology industry to achieve desired efficacy\\nand minimize cost.\\nThe current status of medical records is mostly in the form\\nof incommunicable silos of wasted information for the health\\nsystem and for knowledge acquisition. Laboratories and\\nclinics need to collaborate to accelerate the implementation\\nof electronic health records [8]. Data need to be captured in\\nreal-time, and institutions should promote their transforma-\\ntion into intelligible processes. New scientific and clinical\\nfindings should be shared through open-source, and aggre-\\ngated data must be displayed for open-access by physicians\\nand scientists and made automatically available as point-of-\\ncare information. Integration and interoperability including\\nethical, legal and logistical concerns are enormous, particu-\\nlarly with the forthcoming addition of “omics-based” data.\\nThe simplification, readability and clinical utility of data sets\\nshould be made evident, and each result must be questioned\\nfor its clinical applicability.

The system encourages the\\nsubject to engage in discussions with his persecutor who\\nprogressively learns to moderate such destructive behavior.\\nInitial successes with this technology have been demonstrated\\nby achievement of a lower level of hallucinations and vocal\\nthreats. Perhaps the most useful function will be in care of the\\nelderly, where the frequency, reassuring nature, and kindness of\\nwhat is said are all important elements of improved communi-\\ncation. Avatars have been also applied to home care, and for\\nbiological and physical monitoring with 3D vision [12].\\n3.\\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine:\\nThe Physical Branch\\nThe second form of application of AI in medicine includes\\nphysical objects, medical devices and increasingly sophisti-\\ncated robots taking part in the delivery of care (carebots) [13].\\nPerhaps the most promising approach is the use of robots as\\nhelpers; for example, a robot companion for the aging\\npopulation with cognitive decline or limited mobility. Japa-\\nnese carebots are the most advanced forms of this technol-\\nogy. Robots are used in surgery as assistant-surgeons or even\\nas solo performers [14]. One of the most impressive examples\\nof the utility of robots is their ability to communicate with and\\nteach autistic children. Here, and in many other situations\\nthat might benefit from robotic intervention, important\\nethical considerations will have to be resolved before it will\\nbecome possible to use AI-robots routinely in today's medical\\nenvironment. Apart from ethical issues, a major challenge in\\nthis new dimension of medical care is the clear need for\\nstandardized, comparative evaluation of the effect of robotic\\nsystems on health indicators, and measures of changes in\\npsychological and physical status, side effects, and outcomes [15].\\n4.\\nUse of Robots to Monitor Effectiveness\\nof Treatment\\nRobots can also be useful in the evaluation of changes in\\nhuman performance in such situations as rehabilitation [16].\\nAnother area where AI might be helpfully employed is for\\nmonitoring the guided delivery of drugs to target organs,\\ntissues or tumors. For example, it is encouraging to learn of\\nthe recent development of nanorobots designed to overcome\\ndelivery problems that arise when difficulty of diffusion of the\\ntherapeutic agent into a site of interest is encountered. This\\nproblem occurs when the therapist is attempting to target the\\ncore of a tumor which tends to be less vascularized, anoxic,\\nbut most proliferatively active. To overcome limitations of\\nmechanical\\nor\\nradioactive\\nrobotics,\\nresearchers\\nhave\\nattempted to harness a natural agent with desired properties\\nas a replacement of “intelligent” nanoparticles alone. For this\\npurpose, they are studying a special type of marine coli, called\\nMagnetococcus marinus which travels spontaneously to low\\noxygenated zones. Initial guidance is provided by an external\\nmagnetic source and then inherent properties of nanorobots\\nare put into play. These nanorobots can be covalently bound\\nwith nanoliposomes bearing therapeutic properties. Early\\ndata have disclosed a significant increase in the gradient of\\ndesired drug into the hypoxic zones [17].\\nMost of these novel applications of AI in medicine need\\nfurther research, particularly in areas of human–computer\\ninteractions. Moshimo Mori [18] introduced in 1970 the notion\\nof uncanny valley in which an important theme is the human–\\nrobot interaction (HRI) field. In these studies humanoid robots\\nwere evaluated for their apparent humanity, eeriness and\\nattractiveness as factors making perception of robots either\\nacceptable, feared or rejected [19].\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nAI for personal use is going to stay with us much as genetics will\\ncontinue to provide personal services. It is therefore important to\\nconsider how AI will also serve the development of our health\\ncare systems. Takashi Kido [20] proposed MyFinder as a person-\\nalized community computing to resolve challenges of personal-\\nized genome services, acting jointly with AI and shaping the\\npersonalized and participative health care of the future. The goal\\nof this platform is to provide personal genome environment\\ninteraction in both directions: impact of genes on diseases,\\nhealth and drug responses, and impact of our environment,\\nbehavioral and wellness on our gene activities. The World\\nEconomic 2016 Forum named open AI ecosystem as one of the 10\\nmost important emerging technologies. With the unprecedented\\namount of data available, combined with advances in natural\\nlanguage processing and social awareness algorithms, applica-\\ntions of AI will become increasingly more useful to consumers.\\nThis is particularly true in medicine and healthcare where there\\nare many data to be utilized from patient medical records and\\nlately also from information obtained by wearable health\\nsensors. This huge volume of data should be analyzed in detail,\\nnot only to provide patients who want suggestions about\\nlifestyle, but also to generate information aimed at improving\\nhealthcare design, based on the needs and habits of patients. It is\\nimportant to tear down the prejudices and fears regarding AI and\\nunderstand how it could be beneficial and how we can cope with\\nits perceived or real drawbacks. The biggest apprehension we\\nhave is that AI will become so sophisticated that it will surpass\\nhuman brain capabilities and eventually will take control over\\nour lives. However, if we succeed in creating ethical standards,\\ndeveloping measures of success and effectiveness, making it\\navailable to the mainstream, and not only to the Ivy League\\nmedical institutions, by making AI tools open-source and user-\\nfriendly and of proven clinical utility, then societal benefits will\\naccrue from the use of AI.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Ted VanItallie for\\nhis excellent comments and suggestions and for the editorial\\nreview of their manuscript.

The background of this article is the politics of \\nRussia towards Ukraine since 1991, when this country gained its independence. In the opinion \\nof Russians, Ukraine is a geopolitical misunderstanding, which openly violates the concept of \\n“Russkiy Mir” (the Russian world). This means that Russia constantly aims at maintaining its \\nsphere of influence in terms of the economy and politics in this region, as well as control over the \\nmilitary potential. Russia’s concerns mainly come from Ukraine’s desire to participate in some \\norganisations, such as the EU or NATO.

After that, a conglomerate \\nconsisting of 15 independent nations was formed. The interests, power and the \\nlevel of political and economic development of these countries were varied. From \\na country that extended across 22 million square kilometres and was inhabited by \\napproximately 293 million people, 15 countries with distinct culture, politics and \\neconomy emerged. One of these countries was the above-mentioned Ukraine2.\\nThe rule of changeability, unpredictability and surprise is not only applied in \\nliterature when it comes to describing international relations throughout history, \\nbut also issues concerning new military conflicts. With the flow of time, they \\ntake a completely new form and structure, which is still an innovative, or even \\nevolutionary area for the development of scientific research. \\nTouching upon the issue of the conflict in Ukraine, as a new dimension of war, the \\nauthor deals with a few vital notions, namely: the character of the new dimension \\nof war, the politics of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine, the causes for the \\nconflict in Ukraine and the features of the new war in the Russian-Ukrainian \\nconflict. The last element concerns synthetic conclusions summarising political \\nand military relations between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the results of this \\nconflict influencing the functioning of both countries. \\nThe aim of this article is to depict the Kremlin’s methods of conducting a modern war, \\nwhich is also called a hybrid war.

The scientific community of the War \\nStudies University determines war as the socio-political phenomenon present in \\nthe history of man since the very beginning of his social recognition, with a range \\nincreasing together with the rise of technology. War was a term coined in the XIX \\nand XX centuries and it means: an organised (prepared) form of military conflict \\nbetween countries, nations, blocks of countries and non-state organisations, as \\nthe continuation of politics (ideology, religion) through violence, whose main \\nexpression is armed fighting, the goal of which is to gain certain political, economic \\nor ideological (religious) interests. War is defined as a form of a military conflict \\nwhich, at the same time, is a term with a narrower objective scope, which finds \\nits application in the field of international law”3. A military conflict, apart from \\nwar, encompasses an armed intervention, an armed incident, a military coup, \\na military blockage, the demonstration of power and other things. \\nIn line with the theory of Carl von Clauzewitz, war is distinguished by the very \\nclose relationship between politics, nation and war, the priority of politics towards \\nwar, and treating war (violence) as a political tool4.\\nAccording to C. Clausewitz: every era has its wars, which is why war over the \\nlast decades (at the turn of the XX and XXI century) has gradually and intangibly \\nchanged its character. Alvin and Heidi Toffler write about the dimension of \\na modern war. This couple examine the aspects of modern war. The main thesis  \\nof their publication “War and anti-war” is that there are 3 civilization waves, which \\nrelate directly to all three waves of war. The first one mentioned by the authors is \\nthe agrarian wave, the second is called industrial and the third – modern (post-\\nindustrial). The symbols of each are respectively: a hoe, an assembly belt and \\na computer, which represent those waves through the image5. \\n3 Słownik terminów z zakresu bezpieczeństwa narodowego, 6th Edition, Warsaw, 2008, p. 158.\\n4  C.

Let us present some of their \\ncharacteristic features6:\\n• the parties of the conflict are non-public actors, paramilitary groups, \\nmercenaries controlled by powers (denationalisation or privatisation of war); \\n• dissymmetry, which means that the parties of the conflict are not equal;\\n• it is hard to define the opponent, the aims of the war and determine the \\nbeginning and the end of the conflict; \\n• there are very often cultural, ethic, and religious roots of the conflict;\\n• strategic places and institutions for the state are to be destroyed, since they are \\na target; \\n• the next aim may be the malfunction of an economic situation (short-term) in \\na particular country, in relation with the above-mentioned actions (e.g. a drop \\nin the values of shares of the listed companies);\\n• civilians are the main victims;\\n• unfavourable media propaganda appears that is supposed to worsen the image \\nof a certain country on the international level;\\n• illegal and harmful activity in cyberspace;\\n• these are very often wars of internal character, which become international \\nwith time;\\n• the parties of the conflict are financed through organised crime, selling natural \\nresources, and other illegal sources. \\nThe aim of the “new” war is destruction of the opponent, his economic and \\nmilitary potential. by keeping the soldier apart from the factual battlefield7.  \\nThe determinant of the “threshold of war,” or the factual start of the warfare is \\nthe use of military forces.

Examples of the new dimension of war are: \\nthe Syrian conflict, the Georgian conflict and the one described in this paper, \\nnamely the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. \\nThe politics of the Russian Federation toward Ukraine\\nIn order to have a full understanding of the actions taken by Russia on Ukrainian \\nterritory, one needs to get acquainted with its strategy and geopolitics towards \\nthe post-Soviet states from the very beginning of their independent existence.\\nThe Russian Federation, as a successor to the former Soviet Union, is nowadays \\nviewed as a world power in the international arena. At around 17 million square \\nkilometres, Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, extending \\nacross 2 continents –Europe and Asia. It is also one of the most populous countries \\nwith around 143.5 million people and a vast potential of energy resources. Russia \\nis one of the world’s leading producers of natural gas and oil.

The Ukrainian economy is mostly based on agriculture \\nthanks to its fertile soils. The most significant natural resources of Ukraine are \\niron ore, black coal, manganese ore, and, in minor quantities, gas, oil and amber10. \\nIt is a country politically and economically weak. According to some sources it \\nis a failing country. Apart from that, Ukraine is also corrupt, with a very non-\\ncompetitive, indebted economy, without any policy that would guarantee balance \\nin the geopolitical crisis caused by Russia’s open aggression towards Ukraine. \\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the politics of the Russian Federation \\naimed at acquiring a western legacy, described as norms and values created by the \\nWest. At that time, 2 main schools of thought were created: Atlanticism and Neo-\\nEurasianism11. The forefathers of Atlanticism were: Dimitrij Trenin, Władimir \\nBaranowski, Andrzej Zagorski, Siergiej Karaganow, Aleksiej Rabatow, and Siergiej \\nRogow12. This notion referred to Occidentalism (from XIX century), implying the \\ndevelopment of Russia, cooperating directly with the West and highly-developed \\ncountries in the world. The implementers of Atlanticism were: Borys Jelcyn, \\nAndriej Kozyriew, (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and Jegor Gajdar (Prime \\nMinister). It should be noted that, at that time, Russian’s need to subordinate the \\npost-Soviet states, including Ukraine, was not highlighted13. \\nThe second school of thought, Neo-Eurasianism, alludes to the notion of \\nEurasianism from the beginning of XX century. The forefathers of this concept \\nwere: Aleksandr Sołżenicyn, Aleksandr Dugin, Eligz Pozdniakow, Natalya \\nNarochnitskaya and Gennady Zyuganov. Another important figure who is \\nconsidered to be the implementer of this concept is Jewgienij Primakow, who later \\nbecame the Minister of Foreign Affairs14. According to Neo-Eurasianism, Russia \\nis believed to be a special country, joining the traditions of both continents in \\nterms of history, politics, and culture. Russia is neither European, nor Asian, as it \\nconstitutes the centre of The Old World.

Aleksandr Dugin singles out two opposite civilisations, \\nwhich compete with one another in a natural way, aiming at confrontation; these \\nare the Eastern and Western civilisations15. His vision concerning the place of \\nRussia in the contemporary world is inspired by the words: “Who rules East \\nEurope commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World \\nIsland; who rules the World Island commands the World”16.\\nAs a result, the foreign politics of the Russian Federation were directed to objecting \\nto the increasing domination of the USA in the XXI century. Whereas the post-\\nSoviet states were “forced” to cooperate with Russia. In 1997, Aleksandr Dubin \\nmade the following comment concerning Ukraine: the sovereignty of Ukraine is \\na negative phenomenon for the geopolitics of Russia and may cause a military \\nconflict. Ukraine, as a sovereign country, with its territorial ambitions, may pose \\na threat to the whole of Eurasia. Strategically, Ukraine should be a projection of \\nRussia in the South and in the West”17.\\nThe third, and at the same time the newest, concept concerning the foreign \\npolitics of the Russian Federation, was started in 1999 by Vladimir Putin. It is \\ncalled the concept of dynamic balance18. In other words it can be recognised \\nunder the following names: the concept of pragmatic consensus and multipolar \\nworld order19. It connects the elements proving the uniqueness of Russia in the \\nworld; however, without the element of confrontation with the West. Konstantin \\nSorokin is regarded as the main precursor. The first time this notion had been \\nofficially presented, by Yevgeny Primakov, was at the 51st session of the UN General \\nAssembly. He believed that the world should be multipolar and that Russia should \\nplay a key role in it.

Firstly, it would be the renewal of the position of Russia as a main player \\non the territory of the former Soviet Union. In the future, it also assumes the \\ntransformation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in an integrated \\nregion of the world, capable of development and maintenance of stability.

These are for \\nexample: the anocracy of Victor Yanukovych, fully subordinated to Moscow, \\ncorruption, nepotism, the economic collapse of Ukraine, social injustice, as well as \\nthe case of Julia Tymoshenko, who was about to be acquitted of charges. However, \\nthe main reason is connected with Ukraine’s active interest in participation in \\nwestern association structures, such as the European Union. \\nUkraine’s relations with the European Union started in 1994, since the Partnership \\nand Cooperation Agreement was signed. During the following years, they achieved \\nthis within the framework that the European Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern \\nPartnership was expected to establish. Ukraine, in 2009, was invited to join the \\nEastern Partnership Project within the framework established by the European \\nNeighbourhood Policy24.\\nPoland was also involved in signing the Ukraine-European Union Association \\nAgreement in 2012. In June 2012, the European Parliament decided to send \\na mission there. The delegation consisted of Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski. \\nDespite various objections centred around lies, corruption, blackmail, and the \\nrule of oligarchs in Ukraine, the EU had a positive approach towards this country. \\n“Europe needs Ukraine, considering its demographic potential, its market, \\nmillions of Ukrainians employed in EU countries, as well as in Poland. Ukraine is \\nready to accept our standards, as opposed to Belarus or Russia”25. \\nContrary to the dreams and full involvement of Ukrainians, on 21st November 2013, \\na week before the summit of the East Partnership, the contemporary government of \\nUkraine (under the influence of Moscow) suspended the preparations for signing \\nthe Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement. Prime Minister Mykola \\nAzarov, after the president Viktor Yanukovych gave his opinion, announced that \\nUkraine, in the interest of national security, would not sign this document26. \\n24 https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stosunki_Ukrainy_z_Unią_Europejską [accessed: 15.01.2017].\\n25 P.

This is why Euromaidan was called the \\nRevolution of Dignity. \\nObserving a tense situation in the western part of Ukraine on the night of 21st \\nand 22nd of February 2014, Yanukovych left Kiev and flew to Kharkov.

Destabilisation \\nof this region happened very fast. At the very beginning, they took over some \\nadministrative institutions in Donetsk and announced the creation of the Donetsk \\nPeople’s Republic (DPR). On 11th May 2014, a referendum took place, and the \\nfollowing day DPR announced its sovereignty. This country is only recognised \\nby the Luhansk People’s Republic, Abkhazia and South Ossetia40. At the same \\ntime, there was a referendum in Luhansk, and on 12th May 2014, the so called \\nLuhansk People’s Republic was brought into existence (LPR). On 24th May 2014, \\nthe so called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic signed \\nan agreement on establishing the so called Novorossiya (or New Russia). “It is \\na form of infringement of Ukrainian constitutional law and, as a consequence, \\ninternational law, and it also undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and \\nindependence of Ukraine. It takes place in the conscription process to the illegal \\nseparatist armed groupings, threatening the stability and security of Ukraine”41. \\nOn the other hand, the inhabitants of eastern Ukraine want to be a part of the \\nRussian Federation. They feel Russias when it comes to identity. \\nIn the middle of April 2014, which was the time when the self-proclaimed, \\ninsurgent republics aspired to gaining independence, the Ukrainian forces began \\nan antiterrorist operation (ATO), the aim of which was to regain the buildings \\ntaken over by separatists and leading to the dissolution of their armed groupings. \\nAfter the negotiations held in Geneva, the operation was aborted. It was the \\ntime when separatists decided on leading the offensive and took control of the \\nvast majority of cities in Donbas. After Petro Poroshenko was elected president, \\nthe operations within ATO were intensified. The Ukrainians managed to regain \\na few cities, whereas in July separatists withdrew from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. \\nThe successes of the Ukrainian counteroffensive brought a reaction from the \\nRussian Federation, which started to provide separatists with heavy weapons. \\n40 https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doniecka_Republika_Ludowa [accessed: 16.10.2016].\\n41 The decision of the board 2014/499/WPZiB, from 25th July 2014, changing the decision \\n2014/145/WPZiB concerning the restrictive measures in conjunction with the actions \\nundermining the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, or those \\nthreatening them (CELEX: 32014D0499).\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The crisis scenarios of greatest \\nconcern over the next six to twelve months are a major confrontation between Ukraine and Russia in \\nCrimea and, more likely, a new dispute over the supply of Russian natural gas to Ukraine. This con-\\ntingency planning memorandum does not predict such crises occurring. Rather, it examines how \\nthey might plausibly be triggered, the implications for the United States should they occur, and the \\nsteps the U.S. government might take to reduce the prospects of a crisis and, should it occur, to man-\\nage it.  \\nP O S S I B L E  C R I S I S  S C E N A R I O S   \\nThe dominant factor in Ukrainian political life during the past four years has been the inability of \\nPresident Victor Yushchenko and his prime ministers—with the exception of Yuriy Yekhanurov’s \\nbrief term—to work together to promote coherent executive branch policy. Clashes with Yulia Ty-\\nmoshenko and Victor Yanukovych during their tenures as prime minister are a major reason why \\nUkraine has moved so slowly and haltingly to fulfill its potential in the aftermath of the 2004 Orange \\nRevolution. Following the collapse of efforts between current Prime Minister Tymoshenko and op-\\nposition leader Yanukovych to produce a new rada (parliament) coalition and implement constitu-\\ntional amendments, Ukraine will increasingly become absorbed with a presidential election cam-\\npaign this autumn. \\nUkraine’s relations with Russia remain troubled by disputes over the supply of natural gas, Yush-\\nchenko’s desire to integrate Ukraine into NATO, arguments over the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF), \\nand other difficulties. The Russian leadership has kept up a steady barrage of criticism directed at \\nKiev. At the same time, important European countries have become hesitant in their engagement of \\nUkraine. While the European Union has included Ukraine in its Eastern Partnership policy, Kiev re-\\nmains frustrated with the EU’s continued reluctance to offer Ukraine the prospect of future member-\\nship. As for the United States, Ukrainians worry that the effort to “reset” relations with Russia will \\ncome at their expense. \\nAgainst this difficult backdrop, several scenarios could generate crises in Ukraine.

Although the January multi-year gas contract puts the Ukrai-\\nnian-Russian gas relationship on a more solid foundation than in the past (when one-year contracts \\nexpired on December 31), the contract still has vulnerabilities. Ukraine has been in technical default \\nsince February, when it failed to purchase the minimum quantity of gas it had contracted to buy. (The \\ncontract requires Ukraine to pay for the minimum amount of gas contracted for, whether it takes it or \\nnot; although Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will not seek to collect the debt for \\ngas that was not bought, Gazprom has not agreed to modify the contract.) \\nPutin and other Russians regularly question Ukraine’s ability to pay and to maintain the reliability \\nof the gas pipelines through which 80 percent of Russian gas bound for Europe is transported. Mos-\\ncow also charges that Ukraine is not buying gas to fill the reservoirs in western Ukraine; these are \\ntypically filled in summer months so that gas may be drawn from them in the winter to send to Eu-\\nrope. \\nEither side could trigger a new gas war. Given the impact of the economic crisis, the loss of gas \\nsales and the associated revenues would concern Moscow. Whether they would deter Moscow from \\nprovoking a gas crisis is unclear. They would presumably affect Russian desires to end the crisis—on \\nMoscow’s terms—before too much revenue was lost.

There would have been one in \\nAugust 2008 had the Ukrainian navy deployed to enforce Yushchenko’s decree that BSF warships \\nwhich had participated in operations off Georgia not be allowed to return to Sevastopol. The likelih-\\nood of the crisis probably diminishes as the end of Yushchenko’s term approaches. Polls indicate that \\nYushchenko has virtually no chance of winning reelection. Regardless of whether the next president \\nis Tymoshenko, Yanukovych, or former rada speaker Arseniy Yatseniuk, Ukraine is likely to pursue a \\nmore modest pace in developing its relations with NATO, a more measured tone on support for \\nGeorgia, and more moderate relations with Russia. That presumably would lower Moscow’s interest \\nin any crisis regarding Crimea.  \\n \\nWarning Indicators \\n \\nSeveral actions could signal increased prospects for a major confrontation in Crimea. These include \\nrenewed Russian-Georgian conflict with the participation of Sevastopol-based BSF warships, a big \\npush by the outgoing president to launch negotiations on the BSF’s ultimate withdrawal, an upsurge \\nin issuance of Russian passports in Crimea, and a general escalation in Ukrainian-Russian tensions. \\nDemonstrations in Sevastopol or elsewhere in Crimea also would raise the prospects, given the pos-\\nsibility of a clash (even if unintended) with Ukrainian internal security forces. \\nThe Russian government presumably would not want to be seen as being responsible for generat-\\ning a crisis in Crimea.

At that point, the crisis would \\nlikely escalate, though Kiev and Moscow presumably would work to prevent major hostilities. The \\nKremlin, however, could begin a focused effort to destabilize the Ukrainian government and/or un-\\ndermine Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea. In the worst—and most unlikely—case, it might even \\ninstigate or support an effort by Crimea to break away from Ukraine.  \\n \\nSpecific consequences of such a crisis for the United States would include:  \\n \\n– Kiev would appeal to Washington under the 1994 Budapest memorandum on security assurances, \\nciting Russia’s threat to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. \\n– Some NATO allies would demand that the Alliance take actions to support Ukraine. \\n– Washington would be pressed to reassure certain NATO allies. In particular, those on or near \\nRussia’s borders would cite the Russian threat and push for more tangible signs of U.S. commit-\\nment to defend them from Russia, such as deployment of U.S. Patriot anti-aircraft batteries or \\nother units on their territories. \\n– Ukraine and NATO/EU states would follow the U.S. reaction to gauge the strength of Washing-\\nton’s commitment to Ukraine (and to European security). A weak reaction could undermine U.S. \\ncredibility. \\n– Other NATO allies would question the wisdom of close alliance relations with a Ukraine in crisis \\nwith Russia, likely dividing NATO and the West in their response. \\n– Pursuit of a “reset” in U.S.-Russian relations would become politically untenable in Washington if \\nRussia were seen as provoking the crisis and/or unwilling to resolve it. \\n \\nU.S. Policy Options to Prevent the Crisis \\n \\nU.S. officials should caution Kiev on choosing its disputes carefully with Moscow. For example, con-\\nfronting Moscow with a demand to open negotiations on BSF withdrawal should await a more stable \\npolitical situation in the Ukrainian government. Washington must also ensure that Kiev has a clear \\nunderstanding of how much support it can expect from the United States should it end up in a major \\nconfrontation with Russia.

Rising Russian rhetoric and Ukrainian \\nfailure to pay for gas could signal greater likelihood of a coming spat.

The economic and other pain inflicted on Ukraine and NATO/EU states such as Bulgaria, Roma-\\nnia, and Slovakia would depend on the timing of the crisis. A gas cut-off in summer or early autumn \\nwould be far easier to weather than in January. \\nAnother gas war would test EU solidarity to the extent that EU states were prepared (or not pre-\\npared) to work together. Differing dependencies on Russian gas within the European Union mean \\nthat the impact would fall unevenly: last January, while apartments in Bulgaria and Romania froze, \\nthe gas cut-off had little discernible impact in Germany, France, or most other EU states in Western \\nEurope. Another gas war would highlight the lack of a common EU energy policy and common EU \\nenergy market. \\nTo the extent that Ukraine was seen as responsible for the gas cut-off, EU unhappiness with Kiev \\nwould grow, as would support for pipelines—Nord Stream, South Stream, and Blue Stream II—\\ncircumventing Ukraine.

That said, successive Ukrainian governments have paid little attention to \\nU.S. and European entreaties along this line for the past ten years; there is little reason to expect ac-\\ntion in the run-up to Ukraine’s presidential election. The United States and Europe should consult on \\nways to press Ukraine to address energy reform in a serious manner, perhaps by making such reform \\na condition for Western support for new international financial institution lending to Ukraine. \\nWashington should also consult with the European Union on how it plans to cope with a new gas \\ncut-off, such as transconnector pipelines that would allow western EU members to send gas to coun-\\ntries such as Romania and Bulgaria that are at greater risk in the event of a cut-off. The U.S. govern-\\nment might also consider a stronger push in support of the Nabucco gas pipeline. While not a short-\\nterm solution, it would in the longer term provide a hedge against a new Russian gas cut-off. \\nFinally, Washington should consider the merits of joining with EU countries and international fi-\\nnancial institutions to provide additional financing that might help Ukraine meet its budget deficit \\nand perhaps cover some gas expenditures.

From support for separatists in Moldova to the now seemingly emblematic \\nwar in Georgia, President Vladimir Putin’s tactics regarding the sovereign nations of the \\nformer Soviet Union appear to reflect a larger pattern of destabilization begun more than \\na decade ago. With Ukraine now in the throes of violent conflict, its effects are reverberat-\\ning across the globe. This raises the question of where Ukraine and other stressed areas in \\nformer Soviet republics may be headed—and what an international community interested \\nin stabilizing the situation may be able to do about it. \\nTwo USIP workshops held during the summer of 2014 sought to outline potential drivers \\nof conflict, sketch plausible scenarios that could lead to violent conflict on a major scale, \\nand pinpoint opportunities for peacebuilding. The USIP conflict analysis team then scruti-\\nnized each scenario with a range of specialists and stakeholders, including many regional \\ncivil society activists and American and European experts. This scrutiny resulted in some \\nchanges to the scenarios but, at the same time, broadly reinforced the identified drivers of \\nconflict and underlined the urgency of comprehending and addressing the full scope of the \\npotential for violent conflict across the region and beyond.\\nScenario Analysis\\nScenario analysis is an analytical approach for describing possible futures in situations of \\nhigh uncertainty and complexity that make accurate forecasts impossible. Such an analysis \\nseeks to establish plausible outcomes by first identifying trends and dynamics that will \\ninteract to drive future events, in this case, in the next three to five years.\\nParticipants in June 2014 identified multiple drivers contributing to conflict in Russia’s \\nneighboring regions. Grouped into larger categories, these coalesced into four critical drivers.  \\nFirst is the extent of instability, whether indigenous or externally provoked. Some places \\nmight invite intervention because they are already unstable or on the precipice of conflict; \\nRussia may also simply consider them valuable or important enough to intervene. A succes-\\nsion crisis following the death of a longtime autocratic leader (as is possible in Kazakhstan \\nor Uzbekistan), an increasingly authoritarian regime that manipulates conflict dynamics \\nand suppresses dissent to consolidate power (as appears likely in Azerbaijan), or a large  \\nethnic Russian population with real or imagined grievances (as is true in Ukraine) could all \\nfoment instability.\\nA second driver is Russia’s own regime stability and internal support for Putin. The Krem-\\nlin itself could drive or impede Russia’s motivation and capacity to intervene in a conflict.  \\nPresumably, Putin’s ability or desire to intervene would be based in his comfort that Russia’s \\nkey constituencies support an intervention. Weakness in his leadership might compel an \\nintervention that would stoke Russian nationalist sentiment and support for the Kremlin.\\nThe Western response to Russian action and how it is perceived regionally is a third \\ndriver. A weak Western response to potential conflict might embolden Russian adventurism. \\nA weak response to conflict also might make peacebuilding more difficult.\\nFinally, Putin’s goals and objectives are a key driver. Whether conflict occurs or grows, \\nand how and where it might develop, in part depends on what Putin is seeking to achieve. \\nThe range of possible goals includes, but is not limited to, changing national borders, creat-\\ning frozen conflicts to weaken one or more countries, protecting crucial natural resources, \\nextending spheres of influence for trade and political purposes, increasing Russia’s interna-\\ntional stature, deterring Western involvement in countries important to Russia, and hinder-\\ning the success of the Maidan model in Ukraine so that it has no attraction for the Russian \\npopulace and countries that Moscow seeks to retain in its sphere of influence.  \\nThe views expressed in this report do not necessarily \\nreflect the views of the United States Institute of Peace, \\nwhich does not advocate specific policy positions.\\nTo request permission to photocopy or reprint materials,  \\ne-mail: permissions@usip.org\\nAbout the institute\\nThe United States Institute of Peace is an independent,  \\nnonpartisan institution established and funded by Congress.  \\nIts goals are to help prevent and resolve violent conflicts,  \\npromote postconflict peacebuilding, and increase conflict  \\nmanagement tools, capacity, and intellectual capital  \\nworldwide.

The regions’ frozen conflicts, such as in South Ossetia and Abkhazia or \\nNagorno-Karabakh, could reignite. There could be succession struggles in Uzbekistan and \\nKazakhstan. Regional instability could spill out of conflict in Russia’s north Caucasus. In \\nexploring these scenarios, several key narratives surfaced:\\n• How all the factors played out in Ukraine will be seen in neighboring countries as \\ndeterminative and highly relevant to their own conflict dynamics and policy responses.\\n• As countries proactively test and assess the new contours of regional relations, the \\nregion’s frozen conflicts will become focal points for dynamic and risky interaction.\\n• Putin’s consistent tactic of creating instability in multiple places to maintain overall \\nstrategic control risks overreach and miscalculation. How many instabilities can \\nMoscow manage?\\n• Based on Russian operations in Georgia and eastern Ukraine and its annexation of \\nCrimea, there is a consistency to Putin’s worldview, strategy, and tactics that clearly \\nidentifies other at-risk regions.\\nThis analysis narrowed the focus to three scenarios focused on Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, \\nand Kazakhstan as emblematic of the tensions faced across the former Soviet Union. Explor-\\ning these three scenarios further does not imply that they are the only possible scenarios, but \\nthey do illuminate key driving forces and narratives, which must be monitored and applied \\nproactively to track the potential for violent conflict and corresponding opportunities for \\npreventive action.\\nUkraine: A Constant Boil\\nThe 2014 Ukraine-Russia crisis simultaneously reflects the pattern of trouble stirred in the \\npast decade across the former Soviet Union—the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia and the \\n2008 war in Georgia, for example—and sets the stage for the next three to five years. The \\nunrest in Ukraine has become a signal case, as actions lead to reactions across the post-\\nSoviet independent states and beyond. Governments, civil society, and other players from \\nthe Baltic states, down through Moldova, across to Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and on \\nto Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are watching the instability in Ukraine closely for its potential \\neffects on their own territories. As an example, leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan, which are \\nmembers of the Russian-constructed Eurasian Economic Union, withheld endorsement of the \\nCrimea annexation, signaling their concern over President Vladimir Putin’s actions toward \\nUkraine in light of their own domestic and external vulnerabilities. \\nIn the USIP analysis, the plausible scenario that emerges for Ukraine in the medium term \\nis largely that of the status quo: a constant boil of instability roiled by internal volatility \\nmagnified by external provocations, shaped by Putin’s goals and objectives and the strength \\nof his regime, and modulated based on the effectiveness of the West’s response. Propelled \\nby these four crucial drivers, the current trends in Ukraine are significant and determina-\\ntive, and the crisis continues to reverberate across the region, becoming emblematic of how \\nsimilar dynamics could play out elsewhere. So while the effect of Putin’s actions—a state \\nof constant conflict in Ukraine as outlined in this scenario—may be acceptable to the West \\nin the medium term, the impact has severe implications across Eastern Europe, the Central \\nCaucasus, and Central Asia, as illustrated in the subsequent scenarios involving Nagorno-\\nKarabakh and Kazakhstan.\\nThe 2014 Ukraine-Russia crisis \\nsimultaneously reflects the pattern \\nof trouble stirred in the past \\ndecade across the former Soviet \\nUnion and sets the stage for the \\nnext three to five years. \\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Russian military stepped up its “exercises” near the \\nUkraine border. NATO reported repeated surges of Russian equipment and personnel over \\nthe border and into contested areas. The Western sanctions, amplified by a sudden drop \\nin world oil and gas prices in the autumn of 2014, hit the Russian economy hard but failed \\nto change Putin’s approach. Whatever influence the penalties might have had on Russia’s \\nfinancial power brokers and the Russian public was blunted by the regime’s propaganda and \\nsuppression techniques.\\nIn Ukraine, the October 2014 elections reinforced the pro-European, pro-reform forces in \\nthe parliament, and attention turned to the urgent need to reduce corruption and reform \\nthe country’s economy to implement its association agreement with the European Union and \\nto collect the international financial support necessary to survive the economic crisis. The \\nelected reformers, including civic activists of the Maidan, had a basis from which to work: \\nMore than two hundred experts, civil society organizers, and human rights defenders crafted \\nthe Reanimation Package of Reforms earlier in 2014, proposing specific measures to address \\ncorruption, make procurement more transparent, and overhaul taxes and the judiciary. Now \\nembedded in the parliament and committed to making good on the goals of the movement, \\nthey can carry out those reforms. They are buttressed by Ukrainians’ heightened awareness \\nof their monitoring responsibilities and the consequences of failure.\\nThe Scenario\\nPutin’s Goals and Objectives\\nHowever haphazard and opportunistic in appearance, Russian actions in Ukraine continue \\nto play out as strategic, albeit relatively short-term, maneuvers to achieve Putin’s goals: \\nmaintaining constant conflict, keeping Ukraine off-balance internally, ensuring it remains \\nundesirable to the West, and, more broadly, flaunting Russian might in the face of a mea-\\nsured U.S. and EU response. In the scenario for the next three to five years, Russia opts for \\na persistent state of hostilities and makes no attempt to implement a meaningful peace \\nagreement. Cease-fire violations continue despite the Minsk agreements. \\nExternally Provoked and Indigenous Instability\\nA central problem for Kyiv—and the West—is that it is easier for Russia to destabilize \\nUkraine than it is for the Ukrainian government, even with Western help, to build a more \\nstable and secure state. Putin has matched any heightened Ukrainian military pressure on \\nseparatist-held areas with increased Russian military support to pro-Russian fighters, mak-\\ning it impossible for Ukrainian forces to retake the occupied areas of the Donbas region in \\nA central problem for Kyiv—and \\nthe West—is that it is easier for \\nRussia to destabilize Ukraine than \\nit is for the Ukrainian government, \\neven with Western help, to build a \\nmore stable and secure state.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Even if fighting ceases, the three-year period of autonomy the Minsk agreement \\noriginally granted to the pro-Russian enclave there equates to a de facto frozen conflict. \\nProvocations elsewhere in Ukraine, such as mysterious explosions that seem designed to stir \\nfear that violent conflict might spread, signal the capacity to inflame tensions more widely \\nas well. \\nIn this scenario, Russia’s incursions combine with indigenous stresses as the Ukrainian \\ngovernment yields to pressure from its public and the West to undertake serious governance \\nand financial reforms. Ukraine has adhered to its International Monetary Fund program, \\nallowing the currency to float and to gradually raise the prices of heating and home energy \\nto cover the costs of production and distribution. It now has embarked on reforms of key \\nsystems and institutions, such as pensions, banking, the judiciary, and the civil service—\\nmeasures that will determine the government’s popularity and Ukraine’s trajectory. In the \\nmedium term, the reform efforts continue to test the administration and the parliament as \\nthe country’s elites—oligarchs in particular—waffle about how much they are willing to \\nconcede and citizens rebel against the pain of higher costs. Reforming Ukraine’s state gas \\nmonopoly, Naftogaz, a bastion of corruption and inefficiency, becomes a crucial test.\\nThe question of national identity also continues to loom large for Ukraine in the scenario, \\nas it does for many post-Soviet countries. Russian aggression has served as a rallying point \\nfor Ukrainian national unity.  But the lack of attention by leaders to building, solidifying, and \\nsharpening a national identity that most Ukrainians can embrace leaves citizens floating in a \\ndangerous state of ambiguity and internal tensions. Russia can capitalize on that ambiguity \\nwith a steady injection of divisive propaganda.\\nThe degree of internal instability can be mitigated to a certain extent by Ukrainian civil \\nsociety’s effectiveness in steering a range of conflicting issues and reforms, even as it is buf-\\nfeted by the war in the east and by Russia’s political, economic, and military maneuvers. Civil \\nsociety in Ukraine draws on the hard lessons of the failures of the 2004–05 Orange Revolu-\\ntion as a motivator: Success or failure this time has huge implications for civic activists and \\nhigher-level political calculations in Ukraine, as well as in other nations of the former Eastern \\nBloc, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. \\nThe West’s Response\\nThe constant boil in Ukraine is partly driven by the willingness and ability of the United \\nStates and European powers, such as Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, to \\nsupport Ukraine and motivate Russia to end its aggression. In the scenario, international \\nfinancial aid for Ukraine continues to be conditioned on speedy reforms, straining the soci-\\nety’s ability to absorb a war and an economic crisis. On the military front, the scenario has \\nthe United States delivering increasing levels of training and other military assistance and \\nNATO continuing to expand cooperation with Ukraine on defense reform. \\nBut American and European leaders still demur on stronger measures against Russia over \\nits Ukraine intervention in the hopes of retaining Russian help on other major issues, such \\nas the Iran nuclear talks or an ever-elusive resolution of the war in Syria. Other sovereign \\ncountries of the former Soviet Union and beyond are eyeing the Western response, its atten-\\ntion span, and the strength of its engagement. That, in turn, affects calculations regarding \\nalliances and behavior, such as decisions about diversifying energy sources and trade.\\nRussian Regime Stability\\nThe influence of Western sanctions on Russia depends partly on how much influence the \\naffected business and economic interests wield over Russian leadership—or whether Putin \\ncontrols them.

In Armenia and Azerbaijan, the aftershocks of the Maidan revolution and Russia’s \\nresponse are rippling through a situation that, in the last few years, can best be character-\\nized as a creeping aggression by both sides. \\nArmenia and Azerbaijan are actively testing the new contours of Russian and Western \\nengagement. Civil society members and experts from the region have described the uptick \\nin violence since the summer of 2014 on the Line of Contact and shared borders as tests of \\nRussia’s capacity to deter a violent outbreak over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia’s \\ndefense forces, committed by treaty to defend Armenia against external aggression, will also \\nbe instrumental for keeping Ukraine at a constant boil. Russia’s ability to deploy its military \\nforces throughout the region will be assessed and tested against its cumulative operations \\nin Ukraine. In dynamic conflict situations, these stress tests risk fatal miscalculation.\\nBackground\\nThe bloody 1988 war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh \\nkilled thirty thousand people and left Nagorno-Karabakh and seven contiguous territories \\nof Azerbaijan under Armenian control. The war ended in 1994 with a cease-fire that was \\nsupposed to create the basis for a peace settlement, but the OSCE-sponsored Minsk Group \\npeace negotiations have remained inconclusive—more a routine than a robust undertaking. \\nOne of the strong points of the Minsk Group process was the shared commitment of its \\ncochairs—the United States, Russia, and France—that resulted in a Document of Basic Prin-\\nciples.

Much of the aggressive \\nposturing also occurs through Armenian and Azerbaijani media outlets, which exploit public \\nattitudes on the conflict as directed by the political elites who control them. Weak civil \\nsocieties in both countries often align with elite interests on Nagorno-Karabakh, further \\nacting as conduits for the hardened and hardening conflict rhetoric.\\nThe Scenario\\nHow do the driving factors of regional instability, Putin’s calculations and regime stability, and \\nthe West’s response play out in the next three to five years in the South Caucasus? If Russia \\nrobustly maintains its strategy of destabilizing Ukraine in the medium term, Azerbaijan may \\ncontinue to test Russia’s defense commitment and deterrent resolve, but ineffectively, invok-\\ning a strong Russian counter-response. On the other hand, if Russia becomes militarily bogged \\ndown in Ukraine, with domestic, economic, and social turmoil as a consequence, its deterrent \\ncapacity will be spread too thin, encouraging more incursions by Azerbaijan. If the West further \\nenhances its military and political support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Azerbaijan will, in \\nthe absence of a constructive peace process, leverage Western policy in Ukraine in a bid to \\nregain its lost territories and to partially or fully establish its territorial integrity.  \\nArmenia will be engaged in its own calculus. If it is faced with increasingly aggressive \\nmilitary forays by Azerbaijan, a growing arms imbalance favoring Baku, and deteriorating \\nRussian military capability, Armenia’s escalatory defense posture may become its military’s \\noperational reality. The Azerbaijani government’s continued repression of civil society exac-\\nerbates the above tensions. The only officially acceptable release valve for the pressures of \\nsocietal discontent is the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis. The mounting loss of life from Azerbai-\\njan’s testing of Russia’s deterrent capacity, and counter demonstrations by Armenia of its \\nwillingness to escalate, leads to public outcry and rising pressure for full-scale armed con-\\nflict. Azerbaijan’s Aliyev government, feeling no alternative and seeking to preserve public \\nsupport for the regime, could miscalculate and launch a broader military operation to recover \\nAzerbaijan’s lost territory. Armenia, committed to a policy of escalation, could respond.\\nIn attempting to manipulate the levers of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through both \\narming and peacemaking, Russia may have overestimated its ability to manage multiple \\ninstabilities on its periphery, from Ukraine and Moldova to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\\nIndicators and Opportunities\\nIn the tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, several indicators should be monitored \\nintensively to gauge the direction of events and detect opportunities. These indicators \\ninclude increasing violence on the Line of Contact; increasing societal pressure on the gov-\\nernments in both countries for revenge killings; meetings with Minsk cochair countries that \\nfail to yield concrete actions toward peace; the Azerbaijani government increasing its lob-\\nbying for Western support for its territorial integrity, tied to strengthened Western support \\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Unlike Uzbekistan or \\nKyrgyzstan, which also maintain links to Russia, Kazakhstan’s status as a buffer state and \\npartner in the Eurasian Economic Union necessarily raises the prospect of Russia’s desire to \\nmaintain balance across its shared border. \\nBackground\\nDomestic instability in Kazakhstan is the most plausible reason for Russia to intervene. The \\nunanticipated political departure or sudden death of President Nursultan Nazarbayev is the \\nlargest determinant of Kazakhstan’s domestic stability over the next three to five years. As \\nminority groups, including the many Kazakh Russians who live there, view the president as \\nthe guarantor of an acceptable status quo, the potential for a rise in ethnic tensions after \\nNazarbayev’s exit is real. The Kazakh president is also one of the few regional leaders said \\nto garner Vladimir Putin’s respect, something Nazarbayev’s eventual successor is not assured \\nto inherit. \\nThe current leadership is hesitant to significantly change the Kazakh relationship with \\nRussia, including its status in the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union. Nevertheless,  \\nNazarbayev has clearly become more wary of Russian intentions since the latter’s incursions \\nWith conflict rising on the Line \\nof Contact and on the borders \\nof Armenia and Azerbaijan, it \\nis crucial to consider immediate \\nopportunities to head off the \\nthreat of conflict escalation  \\nover Nagorno-Karabakh.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Like \\nmany of its neighbors, Kazakhstan’s lack of transparency and undefined mechanisms for \\npower transfer make a concrete prognosis difficult, yet the end of Nazarbayev’s rule portends \\nethnic issues, interregional tensions, or a shift in the country’s economic orientation. \\nThe Scenario \\nKazakhstan’s western region bordering the Caspian Sea is home to vast oil reserves and \\nsignificant industrial assets, which are controlled by local oligarchs with limited central gov-\\nernment oversight. With Nazarbayev as the linchpin of political stability, in the next three \\nto five years, a muddled succession could compel local oligarchs in western Kazakhstan to \\ngrab greater autonomy, at the same time making these same business elites vulnerable to \\nPutin’s interests. \\nThe effects of sanctions and the resulting drop in international oil and gas markets \\ncould drive Putin to more aggressively pursue Russia’s position in the Caspian Sea with the \\naim of eliminating any Western military and economic presence in the region. The western \\nregion of Kazakhstan could prove especially enticing to Putin, given its natural resources, \\nits potential for boosting Russia’s economic and geostrategic position, and the presence of \\nan ethnic Russian population that provides a patina of legitimacy for a Russian incursion. \\nClosing western Kazakhstan to U.S. business interests, while gaining control over the hold-\\nings of local oligarchs, would solidify Russia’s Caspian Sea position.  \\nWestern business concerns in Kazakhstan, while significant, are not backed by diplo-\\nmatic and military commitments from western capitals. The geographic position of western \\nKazakhstan, reminiscent of the Crimean Peninsula in terms of its strategic assets, historic \\nassociation with Russia, and the presence of an ethnic Russian population, could be seized \\nby the Russian military and government with similar tactics and strategies. That would leave \\nAstana, in the midst of transition, incapable of mounting a significant response.\\nIndicators and Opportunities\\nA number of internal and external factors could indicate trouble for Kazakhstan’s future stabil-\\nity. The appearance and perpetuation of several warning signs should be carefully observed \\nto determine the most appropriate response. Signs within Kazakhstan might include changes \\nin legal protections for the use of the Russian language; increased repression of religious \\ngroups; greater frequency of violent acts against central government authorities; increases in \\nprovincial, economically-based protests; statements by Kazakh leadership expressing a desire \\nto withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union that elicit strong condemnation from Russia; \\ncalls by local business elites in the Caspian region to rebel against central authorities; and calls \\nby Western energy companies for Kazakh military or international protection of assets follow-\\ning domestic disturbances. External indicators might include Russian reports of oppression in \\nKazakhstan after receiving requests from ethnic Russians asking for Moscow’s protection, Rus-\\nsian claims about the need to recapture “lost” territory or declarations of Kazakhstan’s lack of \\nhistorical validity, and statements from Moscow that Kazakh instability or the introduction of \\nforeign troops in the Caspian Sea will be met with appropriate response.  \\nWhile Washington’s influence in Kazakhstan and Central Asia lags behind Moscow’s and \\nBeijing’s, a number of efforts could be explored to prevent conflict or minimize the effects \\nof an outbreak of hostilities.

A driver of violent conflict \\nfollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union was the newly independent countries’ \\ninability to engage bilaterally to resolve interstate and intrastate tensions that Moscow \\nbrokered previously. The Putin regime today is seeking to retain or reassert its role as \\nregional power broker to maintain hegemony.\\n• Monopolization of the conflict narrative. Moscow has successfully harnessed support for \\nthe war in Ukraine by turning the Maidan narrative on its head, arguing that Ukraine’s \\npolitical transition was a strategic move by the West to make Russia more vulnerable. \\nThis revisionist account of current events has allowed Russia to monopolize the conflict \\nnarrative throughout many neighboring countries. Governments with an already \\nauthoritarian bent have seized on that narrative to crack down on civil society, arguing \\nthat the West is manipulating popular movements to destabilize the region.\\n• Closing of civil society space. The space for civil society to operate and mature is \\nrapidly closing in Russia and most neighboring countries. This strategy affects \\nconflict dynamics in the region by closing societal outlets for dissent and government \\nengagement. Without diverse social perspectives on many of the region’s unresolved \\nconflicts, autocratic regimes control the conflict narratives, hardening societal opinion \\nagainst their resolution to deflect any focus on internal issues.\\nTo mitigate the risk and reality of violent conflict—the primary threat to the region’s \\ndemocratic consolidation—and to offer foreign assistance within the limitations of new \\nregulations on civil society activity in many countries of the region, Western strategies \\nshould aim to degrade Russia’s ability to create the conditions that foment regional conflict.\\n• Create civil society space. Create regional hubs in countries with vibrant civil societies, \\nsuch as Georgia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova, to provide within-region assistance, \\ncounteract Russia’s attempts to direct regional relations, and challenge the narrative that \\ncivil society is a Western imposition by demonstrating that it is organic to the region.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The hybrid war is a kind of war that begins and finishes \\njust before the above mentioned “threshold of war,” which means that military \\nmanoeuvres do not occur at all, or, if so, it happens in the latter course of war.  \\nThe hybridism of war presupposes the coexistence of various of its generations –  \\n6 The conclusions from the analysis of the literature of professor’s Bolesław Balcerowicz \\nand the literature from the War Studies University.\\n7 J.
